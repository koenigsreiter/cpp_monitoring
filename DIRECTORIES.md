@dir include/common Includes common header files used by both clients and servers. These files are header-only and concern themselves with logging and networking.
@dir include/client Includes the class definitions for the client. The files are the `JSON` config parser and the `listener` that is constantly listening for incoming health messages.
@dir include/server Contains header files for the server part. Contains both the `GRPC` server definition and all the different monitors. Also contains the `health_checker` class that is used to determine the availability of each master.
