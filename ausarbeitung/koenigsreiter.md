# Monitoring tool

This is the essay accompanying the Monitoring tool. It will give a quick overview of the problem and will then explain the various subprograms and the required protocols.

## Important information

This program relies uses *C++17* specific features and therefor requires a *C++17* compatible compiler. Although the program has only been tested on a *Linux* system it is most likely that the code also works on other operating systems as the code has been kept as portable as possible.

This document will sometimes show code examples that are not completely correct. If necessary the code example will omit namespces to keep the code readable.

Important expressions:

- *Root of the project*: The root of the project is the directory where the **meson.build** file is located.

## License

The whole project is under the *BOOST* license:

## Code documentation

Every function is documented in its respective header file and the code documentation can be generated using the tool `doxygen`.
To generate the auto-generated documentation the command `doxygen` has to be executed in the root of the project. The generated documentation will be written to the *docs* folder inside the root of the project.

## Used technologies and libraries

The following libraries were used to power the tool:

| Use-Case               | Technology |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Networking             | `asio`     |
| Logging                | `spdlog`   |
| Data serialization     | `protobuf` |
| Remote procedure calls | `gRPC`     |
| Output (Client)        | `fmt`      |
| Configuration (Client) | `JSON`     |
| CLI argument parsing   | `CLI11`    |
